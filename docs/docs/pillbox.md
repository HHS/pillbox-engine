## Update and Compare

Pillbox Engine's Update action box compare Pillbox records against SPL records and updates Pillbox data with newer information from SPL if they are available.

During this process, Pillbox Engine populates a number of comparison tables for SPL score, color, imprint, size, shape and image information. If the SPL data differs from Pillbox data on these fields, a new row is added to each compare table.

The user has to manually check each compare table and verify the errors. Is each record is verified, the corresponding row on Pillbox Data table is updated automatically.

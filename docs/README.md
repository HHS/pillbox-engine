# Pillbox Engine's Documentation

Pillbox is one of the largest free databases of prescription and over-the-counter drug information and images, combining data from pharmaceutical companies, Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and Department of Veterans Affairs.

Pillbox's primary data source (FDA drug lables) is complex and does not organize information based on individual pills. Additionally, there are very few pill images available in the source data. The Pillbox initative has focused on restructuring the source data, incorporating data from other related data sets, and creating a library of pill images.

Pillbox Engine is a local web-based application faciliate data processing for the Pillbox Project by downloading and processing the DailyMed SPL Data.
